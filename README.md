Perfect Code- The solid principles of   
                                                Programming
						
						
What is a perfect and clean code?

Well  a perfect code is code which implements all the solid Design principles of programming and makes the code presentable with least number of error. 

                  Programming is the art of telling another human what one wants the computer to do.
                    â€” Donald Knuth

                                                       

**Reason for Solid principle**

So, what is SOLID and how does it help us write better code? Simply put, Martin and Feathers' design principles encourage us to create more maintainable, understandable, and flexible software.
 Consequently, day by day our applications are growing in size , lowering  the complexity and save ourselves a lot of headaches further down the road!
The following five concepts make up our SOLID principles:

1-Single Responsibility
2-Open/Closed
3-Liskov Substitution
4-Interface Segregation
5-Dependency Inversion
